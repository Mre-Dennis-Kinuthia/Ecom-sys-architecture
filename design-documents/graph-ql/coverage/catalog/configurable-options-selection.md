## Use cases

### Render configurable option values available for selection on the product page

User navigates to the configurable product page. Option values available for selection are rendered on the page.
The user makes a selection for the first option and the list of option values available for selection is updated for the remaining options. The image relevant for the selection is also updated.

### Add to cart

After the user makes final selection, the corresponding simple product data becomes available and the product can now be added to cart.

### Render configurable option values available for selection on the category page

Category and search result pages do not require the list of configurable option values available for selection. A list of all available options is enough
