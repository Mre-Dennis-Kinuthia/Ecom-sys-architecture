# Customer Orders API

# Overview

The GraphQL API should provide a possibility to retrieve orders, shipments, invoices, credit memos for the logged in customer. The current schema allows fetching only simple order details and does not provide a possibility to fetch order details by a number.

The proposed solution is deprecation of `customerOrders` query and addition of `orders` field to the `customer` query:

```graphql
@doc("Query to return a list of all customer orders")
type Customer {
    orders (
        filter: CustomerOrdersFilterInput
        currentPage: Int = 1 @doc("current page of the customer order list. default is 1")
        pageSize: Int = 20 @doc("page size for the customer orders list. default is 20")
    ): CustomerOrders
}

@doc("Collection of customer orders")
type CustomerOrders {
    items: [CustomerOrder]! @doc("collection of customer orders that contains individual order details.")
    page_info: SearchResultPageInfo
    total_count: Int @doc("the total count of customer orders")
}
```

```graphql
@doc("Allows to extend the list of search criteria for customer orders")
input CustomerOrdersFilterInput {
    number: String @doc("Order number. Allows to filter orders by fully or partial entered number")
    status: String @("Order status")
    createdDate: FilterRangeTypeInput
    total: CustomerOrdersAmountFilterInput
    salesItem: SalesItemFilterInput
}

@doc("Provides order total amount search filter")
input CustomerOrdersAmountFilterInput {
    min: Float @doc("Minimum total order amount in store view currency")
    max: Float @doc("Maximum total order amount in store view currency")
}

@doc("Allows to extend the list of search criteria for order items")
input SalesItemFilterInput {
    name: String @doc("Order item name. Allows to filter orders by fully or partial entered order item name")
    sku: String @doc("Order item SKU. Allows to filter orders by fully or partial entered order item SKU")
}
```

> Right now, we don't introduce the filter input for such entities like invoice, credit memo, shipment as all these entities are related to the same order and GraphQL resolvers anyway at first resolve the order and after that other child entities. But, in future, such filter input can be introduced as optional argument.

## Order Type Schema

The proposed type for the customer order might look like:

```graphql
@doc("Customer order details")
type CustomerOrder {
    id: ID! @doc("the ID of the order, used for API purposes")
    order_date: String! @doc("date when the order was placed")
    status: String! @doc("current status of the order")
    number: String! @doc("sequential order number")
    items: [OrderItemInterface]! @doc("collection of all the items purchased")
    total: OrderTotal! @doc("total amount details for the order")
    invoices: [Invoice]! @doc("invoice list for the order")
    credit_memos: [CreditMemo]! @doc("credit memo list for the order")
    shipments: [OrderShipment]! @doc("shipment list for the order")
    payment_methods: [PaymentMethod]! @doc("payment details for the order")
    shipping_address: CustomerAddress @doc("shipping address for the order")
    billing_address: CustomerAddress! @doc("billing address for the order")
    carrier: String @doc("shipping carrier for the order delivery")
    method: String @doc("shipping method for the order")
    comments: [CommentItem]! @doc("comments on the order")
}
```

The `id` will be a `base64_encode(increment_id)` which in future can be replaced by UUID.

> The order `status` should be filtered in the same way as for Luma via `Order Status` and `Visible On Storefront` configuration 

### Order Item

```graphql
@doc("Order item")
type OrderItemInterface {
    id: ID! @doc("Order item unique identifier") #base64encode(orderItemId)
    product_name: String @doc("name of the base product")
    product_sku: String! @doc("SKU of the base product")
    product_url_key: String @doc("URL key of the base product")
    product_type: String @doc("Type of product (e.g. simple, configurable, bundle)")
    status: String @doc("the status of order item")
    product_sale_price: Money! @doc("sale price for the base product including selected options")
    discounts: [Discount] @doc("final discount information for the base product including discounts on options")
    selected_options: [OrderItemOption] @doc("selected options for the base product. for e.g color, size etc.")
    entered_options: [OrderItemOption] @doc("entered option for the base product. for e.g logo image etc.")
    quantity_ordered: Float @doc("number of items")
    quantity_shipped: Float @doc("number of shipped items")
    quantity_refunded: Float @doc("number of refunded items")
    quantity_invoiced: Float @doc("number of invoiced items")
    quantity_canceled: Float @doc("number of cancelled items")
    quantity_returned: Float @doc("number of returned items")
}

type OrderItem implements OrderItemInterface {
}

type BundleOrderItem implements OrderItemInterface {
    child_items: [OrderItemInterface]
}

@doc("Represents order item options like selected or entered")
type OrderItemOption {
    id: String! @doc("name of the option")
    value: String! @doc("value of the option")
}
```
### Payment Method Schema

To provide more customization for different payment solutions, the payment method will be represented by own type instead of simple string:

```graphql
@doc("Payment method used to pay for the order")
type PaymentMethod {
    name: String! @doc("payment method name for e.g Braintree, Authorize etc.")
    type: String! @doc("payment method type used to pay for the order for e.g Credit Card, PayPal etc.")
    additional_data: [KeyValue] @doc("additional data per payment method type")
}
```

> The payment `additional_data` should be filtered in the same way as for Luma via `privateInfoKeys` and `paymentInfoKeys` to not expose sensitive information.

### Amounts Schema

As entities like order, invoice, credit memo might have complex amounts type:

```graphql
@doc("Interface to provide sales amounts")
interface SalesTotalAmountInterface {
    subtotal: Money! @doc("subtotal amount excluding, shipping, discounts and tax")
    discounts: [Discount] @doc("applied discounts")
    total_tax: Money! @doc("total tax amount")
    taxes: [TaxItem]! @doc("order taxes details")
    grand_total: Money! @doc("final total amount including shipping and taxes")
    base_grand_total: Money! @doc("final total amount in base currency")
}
â€‹
@doc("Order total amounts details")
type OrderTotal implements SalesTotalAmountInterface {
   total_shipping: Money! @doc("order shipping amount")
   shipping_handling: ShippingHandling! @doc("shipping and handling for the order")
}

@doc("Shipping handling details")
type ShippingHandling {
    total_amount: Money! @doc("shipping total amount")
    amount_inc_tax: Money @doc("shipping amount including tax")
    amount_exc_tax: Money @doc("shipping amount excluding tax")
    taxes: [TaxItem]! @doc("shipping taxes details")
}

@doc("Tax item details")
type TaxItem {
    amount: Money! @doc("tax amount")
    title: String! @doc("tax item title")
    rate: Float @doc("tax item rate")
}
```

## Invoice Type Schema

The invoice entity will have the similar to the order schema:

```graphql
@doc("Invoice details")
type Invoice {
    id: ID! @doc("the ID of the invoice, used for API purposes")
    number: String! @doc("sequential invoice number")
    total: InvoiceTotal! @doc("invoice total amount details")
    items: [InvoiceItemInterface]! @doc("invoiced product details")
    comments: [CommentItem]! @doc("comments on the invoice")
}

@doc("Invoice item details")
type InvoiceItemInterface {
    id: ID! @doc("invoice item unique identifier") #base64encode(invoiceItemId)
    order_item_id: String @doc("link to order item")
    product_name: String @doc("name of the base product")
    product_sku: String! @doc("SKU of the base product")
    product_type: String @doc("Type of product (e.g. simple, configurable, bundle)")
    product_sale_price: Money! @doc("sale price for the base product including selected options")
    discounts: [Discount] @doc("final discount information for the base product including discounts on options")
    quantity_invoiced: Float @doc("number of invoiced items")
}

type InvoiceItem implements InvoiceItemInterface {
}

type BundledInvoiceItem implements InvoiceItemInterface {
    child_items: [InvoiceItemInterface]
}

@doc("Invoice total amount details")
type InvoiceTotal implements SalesTotalAmountInterface {
    total_shipping: Money! @doc("order shipping amount")
    shipping_handling: ShippingHandling! @doc("shipping and handling for the order")
}
```

The `id` will be a `base64_encode(increment_id)` which in future can be replaced by UUID.

## Refund Type Schema

The credit memo entity will have the similar to the order and invoice schema:

```graphql
@doc("Credit memo details")
type CreditMemo {
    id: ID! @doc("the ID of the credit memo, used for API purposes")
    number: String! @doc("sequential credit memo number")
    items: [CreditMemoItem]! @doc("items refunded")
    total: CredtiMemoTotal! @doc("refund total amount details")
    comments: [CommentItem]! @doc("comments on the credit memo")
}

@doc("Credit memo item details")
type CreditMemoItem {
    id: ID! @doc("Credit memo item unique identifier") #base64encode(creditMemoItemId)
    order_item_id: String @doc("link to order item")
    product_name: String @doc("name of the base product")
    product_sku: String! @doc("SKU of the base product")
    product_sale_price: Money! @doc("sale price for the base product including selected options")
    discounts: [Discount] @doc("final discount information for the base product including discounts on options")
    quantity_invoiced: Float @doc("number of invoiced items")
}

@doc("Credit memo price details")
type CredtiMemoTotal implements SalesTotalAmountInterface {

}
```

The `id` will be a `base64_encode_encode(increment_id)` which in future can be replaced by UUID.

## Shipment Type Schema

```graphql
@doc("Order shipment details")
type OrderShipment {
    id: ID! @doc("the ID of the shipment, used for API purposes")
    number: String! @doc("sequential credit shipment number")
    tracking: [ShipmentTracking] @doc("shipment tracking details")
    items: [ShipmentItem]! @doc("items included in the shipment")
    comments: [CommentItem]! @doc("comments on the shipment")
}

@doc("Order shipment item details")
type ShipmentItem{
    id: ID! @doc("Shipment item unique identifier") #base64encode(shipmentItemId)
    order_item_id: String @doc("link to order item") 
    product_name: String @doc("name of the base product")
    product_sku: String! @doc("SKU of the base product")
    product_sale_price: Money! @doc("sale price for the base product")
    quantity_shipped: Float! @doc("number of shipped items")
}

@doc("Order shipment tracking details")
type ShipmentTracking {
    title: String! @doc("shipment tracking title")
    carrier: String! @doc("shipping carrier for the order delivery")
    number: String @doc("tracking number of the order shipment")
}
```
The `id` will be a `base64_encode(increment_id)` which in future can be replaced by UUID.

## CommentItem type
```graphql
type CommentItem {
    timestamp: String! @doc("The timestamp of the comment")
    message: String! @doc("the comment message")
}
```

## Additional Types

The `KeyValue` type will provide a possibility to use key-value pairs:

```graphql
@doc("The key-value type")
type KeyValue {
    name: String @doc("name part of the name/value pair")
    value: String @doc("value part of the name/value pair")
}
```
